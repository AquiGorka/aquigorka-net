## What's the farthest that you've ever been?

> The world rocks

> You rock my world - Eels


Sometimes all you need is to let go - common place, yeah, but still, the feeling is sincere. Recently several things have made me come back to this idea (a manga I read, a tv show I follow and a genius I follow in github at an event I attended), it is awesome how sometimes (or maybe all of those times) thinking outside of the general line of thouhgt brings insight.

Anyways, I have been following a couple of mad scientist: @substack, @mafintosh and @dominictarr and man, I got to say there on to someting: peer to peer communications.

We've seen how facebook rocked our world, everybody wants to share stuff - apparently everything, not just stuff - yet, it is not cool that a central "authority" controls this sharing, hence, a few of us react accordingly (pun intended) and follow our gut: we need to develop the Internet we dream of and this has to be the *real internet, the internet people will use on a day to day basis*.

What does that mean?

It means: regular people, third world countries (not broadband connected countries), accesibitly-less first. Devs need to remember clicks are clicks because a blind people need screen readers (so, no fancy interactions); people use and will continue using the websites we develop, and this need to be regular-people friendly.

A hawaiian sliper-wearing-hipster showing off his vi-skills made his point or maybe, it is time we feel empathy for the rest of us - and realize, the world won't catch up any time soon and early adopters is not a "you can easily join" type of club. It would be awesome if the rest of the world could really fill the "shoes of their peers" - but it won't happen anytime soon, so share, listen, share again, talk about it, talk about every little detail - it makes a difference, it is amazing and awesome that you do.

And don't forget to tell me about it, I'd love to hear your stories.

Cheers,
Gorka
