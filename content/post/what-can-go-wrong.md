## Whats the farthest you've ever been?

> You rock my world - Eels


Sometimes all you need is to let go - common place, yeah, but still, the feeling is sincere. After a few times I've come back to this idea (a manga I read, a tv show I follow and today one of the genius I follow in github gave a talk at an event I attended), again it comes to me, it is awesome how somtimes (or maybe all of those times) thinking outside of the general line of thouhgt brings insight.

Anyways, I have been following a couple of mad scientist: @substack, @mafintosh and @dominictarr and man, I got to say there on to someting: peer to peer communications.

We've seen how facebook rocedk our world, everybody wants to share stuff - apparently everything, not just stuff - YET, it is not cool that a central "authority" controls this sharing, hence, a few of us react accordingly (pun intended) and follow our gut: we need to develop the Internet we dream of and this has to be the *real internet, the internet people will use on a day to day basis*.

What does that mean?

It means: regular people, third world countries, not-broadband, accesibitly-less, remmeber clicks are clicks because a blind person NEEDS a screen reader type of; people use and will continue using the websites we develop.

So true. A hawaiian sliper-wearing-hipster showing off his vi-skills made his point or maybe, it is time we feel empathy for the rest of us - and realize, the world won't catch any time soon and early adopters is not a "you can easily join club". It would be awesome if the rest of the world could really fill the "shoes of their peers" - but it won't happen anytime soon, so share, listen, share again, talk about it, talk about every little bit of it - it makes a difference, it is amazing and awesome that you do.

And fucking hell, tell me about it, I'd love to hear your stories.

Cheers,
Gorka
