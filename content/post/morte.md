*Massive/Multiplayer Online Real-Time Experiences*

> Massive/Multiplayer

Social games and the social layer for games. It is always a more engaging experience to share and play with others.

> Online

Via the Internet anyone can join from anywhere, from your own home to any social gathering, even out in the street. 

> Real-Time

At a given specific time join and be part of the activity.

> Experiences

This activities are more than events (even though I don't think anyone is doing any type of events that resemble this activities) what you are left with are experiences of how you interacted and how you behaved and enjoyed with the dynamics.
